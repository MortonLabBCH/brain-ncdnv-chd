### Description

Analyses performed for the study:

*   Variant score prediction using the deep learning models [Basenji2](https://github.com/calico/basenji) and [Enformer](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/enformer)
*   Weighted correlation network analysis ([WGCNA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/index.html))
*   Gene set enrichment analysis ([clusterProfiler](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler))

### Requirements 

Deep learning models are implemented in `Python` and their corresponding requirements and usage can be seen in their repositories. WGNCA nad GO enrichment analysis were carried out in `R`. All scripts were executed on `Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.1)`.
